    The first and most important step in developing generative AI is data. 
    Models are trained on curated datasets sourced from various parts of the internet, not the entire internet.
    """)
    st.warning("""
    ‚ö° Training is resource-intensive: 
    - 10 TB of text data
    - 12 days of processing
    - ~$2 million in cost

    Only major companies can afford to develop large-scale generative AI systems.

    To use it effectively:
    - Provide specific context.
    - Ask it to summarize, rewrite, or structure information.
    - Avoid relying on it for absolute facts.

    Even with internet access:
    - AI scans limited pages.

    - GenAI operates probabilistically, not through mechanical algorithms.

    AI predicts the next word based on probabilities for 50,000+ options.
